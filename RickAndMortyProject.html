                    <p>Before moving to the editor and making the game. I designed the story and the character behavior. I used simple pen and paper for this. I knew in order to complete this project I have to go through 3 important process - (i) Design
                        (ii) Implementation and (iii) Publishing.</p>

                    <p>Since I already know C++ and Java. Since I have done a lot of&nbsp; Object Oriented Programming in the past, so it was easy for me to grasp C# for Unity. I went through few YouTube videos to learn about the unity editor. I have not
                        wasted a lot of time on this videos. Just 1/2 hours may be. Then I came to know about Rigidbody 2D, box collider 2D etc and how to use them in the scripting. Since I have decided to do project based learning for this. So I jumped
                        directly into the Game.</p>

                    <p>I have decided to use GIF for the players and enemies as it will give a special touch to the user. But then when I tried to use them in the unity they were still, they were not moving. I did't knew what was wrong with it. So like any
                        other developer I googled it and came to know that you can't use GIF directly into unity. So I knew what was the problem now I need the solution. Again I googled it, then after doing some research - went through a lot of documentation
                        and blogs. I came to know that there is a way to use GIF in unity but as a sprite sheet. Now I need to know what is&nbsp; a sprite sheet. I went through a lot of documentation. I used Adobe Photoshop 2020 to convert GIF into sprite
                        sheet and used them n my project. Wabalaba-dub-dub they were moving now as they should in he first place.<br></p>

                    <p><br>Now I was able to play the game with the GIF as the player and enemies but they were silent. Now I need to put sounds in my game. But I did't know how to. So again I went through some blogs and documentation and I was easy. To
                        edit the sound I used Audacity. It is simple free to use software.<br></p>

                    <p><br>Everything was nice but something was missing from the game. I play a lot of games and the big games have an intro video to tell more about the story. So I decided to make an Intro video in HitFilm Express. I knew video editing
                        since class 12 so I used that skill to make an awesome intro. Let me tell you one thing about video editing, It takes a lot of time.<br><br></p>

                    <p><br>The game is completed. Now I need to Upload this game in Google play store. But i got some error, I need to make key store and all that thing before publishing. OK I did that but again few problems. Then I came to know that google
                        accepts only 64 bit games as of the recent policies and the target SDK version should be at least API level 29.&nbsp; I fixed all that and uploaded it again with new build version. The request was pending. Then after few days an
                        email came to me from google that the game was rejected as RICK AND MORTY is not my property. It belongs to Adult Swim co. It was true :D . So you can find this game in Playstore. But I will give a link to my game - Google Drive
